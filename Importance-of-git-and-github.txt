EXPLANATION OF THE IMPORTANCE OF GIT AND GITHUB

The importance of Git is to eliminates everything from the time wasted passing commits
over a network connection to the man hours required to integrate changes in a centralized version control system.

GitHub it is a website for developers and programmers to collaborate work on code.  The primary benefit of this website
is the version control system, because this will allows collaboration with their group or workmates (push or pull)
without compromising the integrity of the original project.
